# Movie-Review-Clustering
sentiment Analysis with word2vec
This project involves clustering a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews into two categories: negative and positive. The clustering is performed using the K-means algorithm, and Word2Vec is incorporated for feature representation.
The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, and each review serves as a data point for clustering. The reviews may vary in length and content, reflecting diverse opinions on movies. The dataset can be find at [IMDB datset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download).
Prior to clustering, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data. This includes tasks such as removing stop words, handling punctuation, and lemmatization.
